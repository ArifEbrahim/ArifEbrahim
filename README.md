Hey there, I'm a software developer based in London. I enjoy solving difficult problems by writing clean, testable and DRY code. 

I recently graduated from Europe's leading coding bootcamp [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) which taught me the fundamentals of software development like **TDD, Agile software development, OOP and debugging**. I documented what I learned each week at Makers in my [Learning Log](https://github.com/ArifEbrahim/learning-log). 

I'm now loooking for my first role in tech so I can build amazing software for an innovative company.
